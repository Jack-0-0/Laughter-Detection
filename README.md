# Laughter Detection
This project aims to detect laughter in human speech. There are three subsections, preprocessing, train and evaluation. Each section uses outputs from the previous section.

* preprocessing – how to convert the three audio datasets into the datasets used to train and test the network.
* train – how to train the laughter network.
* evaluation – how to evaluate the performance of the network on the different language test sets.
